# ClassBuilder
ReClass.NET is an amazing tool for inspecting data structures, but it lacks in many areas. ClassBuilder is an effort to create a tool that solves the issue of these lacking ReClass.NET features.

## Where does ReClass.NET lack?
One area would be project collaboration. Two people could not work on one project at the same time without the headache of manually extracting the project and merging changes together. Its project format is a ZIP package with the contents inside.

## Better together
You'll likely find that ReClass.NET has features that ClassBuilder does not. In ways, it would be best to use a combination of both.
